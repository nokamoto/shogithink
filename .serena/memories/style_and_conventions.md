# Code Style and Conventions

## Go
- Follows standard Go conventions: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for exported symbols.
- Use `go fmt` for formatting.
- Use `go vet` for linting.
- Comments should be complete sentences, starting with the name of the function/type.
- No explicit type hints (Go is statically typed).

## Python
- Follows PEP8 style (if Python code is added): snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes.
- Use docstrings for functions/classes.
- Type hints recommended for clarity.

## General
- MIT License applies.
- Use Mage for automation tasks.
